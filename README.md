# ‚ö†Ô∏è This repository is outdated.
TL;DR ‚Äî an extremely unfinished WIP of the new project can be found here: https://github.com/Suslanium/SkyUnity

This project is currently slowly being rewritten from scratch since the current version is poorly written in many places. I started this project back in 2023, and I wasn't really good in terms of code quality and architecture back then, so, over time this project became a mess that is hard to manage and update, so I decided to rewrite it while also improving it (performance- and feature-wise) along the way. ~~The new project will be made public when it reaches the same functionality as this one.~~ The new project is available at the link above, but it is still far from even loading interior locations. The latest version of this (old) project is available on the develop branch.

A WIP project whose goal is to run TES V: Skyrim on the Unity engine. Currently this **works ONLY with Skyrim LE (aka Oldrim)**. SE/AE support will be added once basic features are implemented.

**~~‚ùÑÔ∏èCurrently almost frozen due to lack of free time. The development will likely continue in the summer~~ This project is outdated and probably will not be updated anymore**

##### ~~Setup~~:
~~A guide for setting up and running this project in Unity will be made after the first stable 'release' (once some basic stuff will be properly done)~~

# Current state
This project is in a *very* early stage of development. Currently it can load interior cells and exterior worldspaces from Skyrim at a very basic level (no sky, no water/FX, not all objects are imported, etc).

##### ~~TODO list~~:
+ ‚úÖ**Add support for cell lighting import** *(Done at a basic level)*
+ ‚úÖ**Add support for transparent materials** *(Done)*
+ ‚úÖ**Figure out glossiness and specular map tint** *(Kind of done, though shaders are still not perfect at all)*
+ ‚ö†Ô∏è**Add occlusion culling** *(It works, but it is still far from perfect. Most likely it will be rewriteen from scratch later)*
+ ‚úÖ**Add support for collisions** *(Almost done; convex shapes and compressed meshes are supported as of now)*
+ ‚úÖ**Add a player that can walk around and explore the world** *(Done)*
+ ‚úÖ**Optimize cell loading** *(Done, the cells now load with almost no lag)*
+ ‚úÖ**Add support for doors inside cells** *(Done, the door teleports now work correctly)*
+ üîÑ*Refactor the code and add comments/documentation* *(Right now the code quality is pretty rough, there are some very long files, a lot of code that may be difficult to understand and maintain in the future, etc.)*
+ üî≤Figure out exterior cell loading *(Terrains, cell grid, LODs, etc)* **UPD: partially done (No LODs)**
+ üî≤Add support for Skyrim SE meshes and archives
+ üî≤Add support for billboards
+ üî≤Add collectable items
+ üî≤Add support for nif-embedded animations
+ üî≤Add support for skinned meshes and skeletons
+ üî≤Add support for .hkx animations (this may be not possible)
+ üî≤Add support for effects (magic, fx, etc.) (this may be not possible)
+ üî≤Etc.
